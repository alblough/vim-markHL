Marks highlight

Forked version of markHL script by Ignacio Nunez:
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=3394

Has different approach in determining next available mark and has mark toggling
functionality rather then on/off which allows to reduce the number of mapped
keys for a still convenient usage of markHL.
